1- CorrelationMatrix.png

	This figure it shows how the features are correlated to it's classes. The benefit of this is to get the relevant features.
	
	--> This image to be used on the preprocessing section.
	
2- featureCorrelation.png
	
	Features correlations helps us compare each feture with eack other and then eliminate redundent features so that the model is not distorted.
	
	Looking at the graph output.png, we can see that there are correlations between "direct_bilirubin" and "total_bilirubin" (strong), "aspartate_aminotransferase" and "alamine_aminotransferase" (a little strong), "albumin" and "total_protiens" (a little strong), "A/G" and "albumin" (a little strong). Let's calculate the Standard correlation coefficient (pearson)!
	
	--> I think the second describtion is not useful because we did not reduce our features in the code. So better we do not talk about it.(Salman)
	
3- ConfusionMatrices.png

	This figure shows the confusion matrices of all of our models.
	
	--> We can split the image into 7 smaller images for each model. (Salman)
	
5- datasetSample.png

	This figure or table is showing few sample data of our dataset after we did the preprocessing phase.
	
6- datasetSampleRaw.png

	This figure or table is showing few sample data of our dataset before doing preprocessing phase.
